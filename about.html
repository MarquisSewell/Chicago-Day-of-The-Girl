       	<h3>In 2012, the United Nation declared October 11 International Day of the Girl. Since that time, Girls Like Me Project, Inc. (an Illinois not-for-profit that provides programming for inner-city girls of color) became the first organization to host a local Chicago Day of the Girl, which has become our flagship program.

During International Day of the Girl, millions of girls and women around the globe join the collective movement to advocate for, as well as, educate girls. This day is also a day to shed light on social and political injustices impacting girls.

This is why Girls Like Me Project, Inc. and our partners continue to join the movement. As producers of “Chicago Day of the Girl” our event connects Chicago's inner-city girls to a global community, celebrates them, and advocates for their success beyond the myriad of injustices they face including poverty, environmental, education and health inequities; media stereotypes; and violence among others.

Right here in Chicago, we convene more than 150 adolescent girls ages 13-18. The FREE event takes place on Saturday, October 11 and will feature community resource sharing, food, thought-provoking programming including interactive fun games, cultural performances and panel discussions, as well as intentional engagement with prospective mentors.

We've grown each year from 80 attendees to now an expected 150! Feel free to check out our photo albums from 2012 and 2013 on our Facebook page. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.596040937098576.1073741830.390652947637377&type=3"></h3>
